# react-native-safari-extension

## What is it?

An [Expo Config Plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction/) that allows you to add a Safari Extension to your iOS apps. This plugin allows you to manage your extension files outside of the `ios` directory with the help of Expo Prebuild. It will continuously generate your native project with your extension files included.

> **Note** Not sure what Safari Extensions are? Check out [Apple's Safari Extension documentation](https://developer.apple.com/safari/extensions/) to learn more.

## Getting Started

- [Basic Workflow Setup Guide](./docs/Basic.md)
- [Experimental Workflow Setup Guide](./docs/Experimental.md)

> **Note:** Not sure which workflow to use? Check out the [Workflows](#workflows) section below.

## Workflows

There are two workflows for using this plugin:

### ðŸ’¯ Basic Workflow

Build your own extension using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

### ðŸš€ Experimental Workflow

Render React Native web inside of your extension. This uses Expo web and Metro to output your React Native compononents inside of the extension popup. You can use Fast Refresh to see your changes in real time.

### Which workflow should I use?

If you are building a simple extension, the Basic Workflow is probably the best option. If it's more complex, you may want to use the Experimental Workflow (it's also more fun).
