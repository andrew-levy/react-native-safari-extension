# react-native-safari-extension

> **Warning** This plugin is a work in progress so there may be some bugs. Please feel free to contribute by reporting any issues or opening a PR.

## What is it?

An [Expo Config Plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/config-plugins/) that allows you to add a Safari Extension to your iOS apps.

Safari Extensions usually live inside of your project's native `ios/` folder, making it difficult to manage if you don't have access to it directly (i.e. Expo's managed workflow, or if you are using EAS to build your app). This plugin allows you to manage your extension files outside of the `ios/` folder, by using Expo Prebuild to setup your extension in the generated native project automatically.

> **Note** Not sure what Safari Extensions are? Check out [Apple's Safari Extension documentation](https://developer.apple.com/safari/extensions/) to learn more.

## Workflows

There are two workflows for using this plugin:

### ðŸš€ Experimental Workflow

Render React Native web inside of your extension. This uses Expo web and Metro to output your React Native compononents inside of the extension popup. You can use Fast Refresh to see your changes in real time.

### ðŸ’¯ Basic Workflow

Build your own extension using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

### Which workflow should I use?

If you are building a simple extension, the Basic Workflow is probably the best option. If it's more complex, you may want to use the Experimental Workflow (it's also more fun).

| Feature / Workflow             | Experimental Workflow | Basic Workflow |

| Manage files outside of `ios/` | âœ…                    | âœ…             |
| Expo Prebuild                  | âœ…                    | âœ…             |
| Fast Refresh                   | âœ…                    |                |
| Expo Web                       | âœ…                    |                |

## Getting Started

- [Experimental Workflow Setup Guide](./docs/Experimental.md)

- [Basic Workflow Setup Guide](./docs/Basic.md)

## Roadmap to v1.0

- [x] Document production workflow. What manual changes need to be done when using the production output compared to the development server? Is there a way to test this locally?
- [x] Customize dev server port (currently hard coded to 8081)
- [x] Document `isSafariExtension`
- [ ] Add link to download sample extension (can this be done in markdown? backup plan is to just clone the repo and copy the folder)
- [ ] Load assets
- [ ] Expo router example
- [ ] Basic example
- [ ] Document `popup.html` and all files that need to be included in the extension
- [ ] Rename `public` to `extension-resources` or something similar
- [ ] Document debugging tips. Use safari...
